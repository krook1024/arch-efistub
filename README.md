So basically I was playing around and trying to find a way to replace GRUB, the
bootloader most people and GNU/Linux distributions use. As it turns out, if you
have an *EFI*-compatible system, you can actually directly instruct the firmware
to load the *OS* for you.

This is a little "wizard" to help you and me do it again the next time.

The [EFISTUB](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/EFISTUB) page from the
[Arch Linux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/) has been a huge help to me
regarding the subject.
